.. class:: infomark

**Purpose**

FastQC aims to provide a simple way to do some quality control checks on raw
sequence data coming from high throughput sequencing pipelines. 
It provides a modular set of analyses which you can use to give a quick
impression of whether your data has any problems of 
which you should be aware before doing any further analysis.

The main functions of FastQC are:

- Import of data from BAM, SAM or FastQ files (any variant)
- Providing a quick overview to tell you in which areas there may be problems
- Summary graphs and tables to quickly assess your data
- Export of results to an HTML based permanent report
- Offline operation to allow automated generation of reports without running the interactive application

**FastQC documentation**

This is a Galaxy interface to the external package FastQC_.
Specific documentation on FastQC can be found on that site.
FastQC incorporates the Picard-tools_ libraries for sam/bam processing.

 .. _FastQC: http://www.bioinformatics.bbsrc.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/
 .. _Picard-tools: http://picard.sourceforge.net/index.shtml

The contaminants file parameter was borrowed from the independently developed
fastqcwrapper contributed to the Galaxy Community Tool Shed by J. Johnson.

.. class:: infomark

**Inputs and outputs**

This wrapper will accept any fastq file as well as sam or bam as the primary file to check.
It will also take an optional file containing a list of contaminants information, in the form of
a tab-delimited file with 2 columns, name and sequence.

The tool produces a single HTML output file that contains all of the results, including the following:

- Basic Statistics
- Per base sequence quality
- Per sequence quality scores
- Per base sequence content
- Per base GC content
- Per sequence GC content
- Per base N content
- Sequence Length Distribution
- Sequence Duplication Levels
- Overrepresented sequences
- Kmer Content

All except Basic Statistics and Overrepresented sequences are plots.
